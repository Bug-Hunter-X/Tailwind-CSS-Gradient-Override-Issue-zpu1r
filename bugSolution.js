```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500">
{/* ... */}
</div>
```
Instead of conflicting background classes, consider using a single gradient or layering background images via CSS, if needed for more complex designs. Make sure to carefully check for and remove conflicting background classes. Prioritize the gradient by placing its classes before any others.
