```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 ...">
{/* ... */}
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient utility classes. However, if the `...` contains classes that conflict with the gradient, it may not render correctly.  For example, using `bg-red-500` within the element would override the gradient.
